# Team-Nova-winning-Submission
  I took part in the DataFest Africa 2022 Datathon with my teammates, and we ended up winning the competition. In this contest, I assumed the position of a data scientist and data storyteller.  
  
  In the competition's final round, I worked as a data analyst for Zentel Network Service Center, a telecommunications hub that required assistance to improve the operation of its ticketing system. My teammates and I used the 5 W's & H method to attack this issue and deliver a solution to the business while paying close attention to the needs of the stakeholders.
    I used the following skills in this competition: Data analysis with Python and excel, data vizualization with Matplolib and Power bi, data storytelling and transferable skills like: design thinking, presentation, communication and critical thinking.
